# Machine Learning Algorithm Testing

A Jupyter Notebook based project, which was testing different Machine Learning algorithms on a given dataset with chess endgames (King - Rook - King).
The program was designed to guess, for a given chess situation expressed as 3 pairs of coordinates of a white king, a white rook and a black king, how many moves it will take for the white to checkmate the black.
The expected result is given assuming it is black's turn and both black and white move as optimally as possible.
